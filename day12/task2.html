        <summary>Palak paneer </summary>
        <p>Palak paneer or palak chhena is an Indian dish consisting of chhena or paneer in a thick paste made from pur√©ed spinach, called palak in Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, and other Indian languages.

            The terms palak chhena and saag chhena are sometimes used interchangeably in restaurants in the Anglosphere. However, saag chhena is different from traditional palak chhena in that it contains other green leafy vegetables, such as mustard greens, whereas palak paneer only contains spinach. Dhaba restaurants often specialize in palak chhena</p></details>

    <summary>prawns</summary>
    <p>Prawn is a common name for small aquatic crustaceans with an exoskeleton and ten legs (members of the order of decapods), some of which are edible.

        The term prawn is used particularly in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Commonwealth nations, for large swimming crustaceans or shrimp, especially those with commercial significance in the fishing industry. Shrimp in this category often belong to the suborder Dendrobranchiata. In North America, the term is used less frequently, typically for freshwater shrimp. The terms shrimp and prawn themselves lack scientific standing. Over the years, the way they are used has changed, and in contemporary usage, the terms are almost interchangeable.
