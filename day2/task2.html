<h2>PROJECTS</h2>
<h2>PROJECT NAME:Phishing url detection:A Real Case Scenario through Login URLs</h2>
<h2>PROJECT DETAILS</h2>
<p>Phishing is a social engineering cyberattack where criminals deceive users to obtain their credentials through a login form that submits the data to a malicious server. In this paper, we compare machine learning and deep learning techniques to present a method capable of detecting phishing websites through URL analysis. In most current state-of-the-art solutions dealing with phishing detection, the legitimate class is made up of homepages without including login forms. On the contrary, we use URLs from the login page in both classes because we consider it is much more representative of a real case scenario and we demonstrate that existing techniques obtain a high false-positive rate when tested with URLs from legitimate login pages. Additionally, we use datasets from different years to show how models decrease their accuracy over time by training a base model with old datasets and testing it with recent URLs. Also, we perform a frequency analysis over current phishing domains to identify different techniques carried out by phishers in their campaigns.</p>
<h2>PROJECT NAME:Predicting hot events in the early period through Bayesian model for social networks</h2>
<h2>PROJECT DETAILS</h2>
<p>Predicting emerging hot events in an early stage is essential for various applications, including information dissemination mining, ads recommendation and etc. Existing techniques either require a long-term observation over the event or features that are expensive to extract. However, given limited data at the early stage of an emerging event, the temporal features of hot events and non-hot events are not distinctive enough yet. In this work, we introduce BEEP, a Bayesian perspective Early stage Event Prediction model, that tackles this dilemma. We formulate the hot event prediction problem by two Semi-Naive Bayes Classifiers, where we consider both the temporal features and structural features and perform distribution test for the selected features. Theoretical analysis and extensive empirical evaluations on two real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.</p>
