             <p><b>project Details:</b>Phishing is a social engineering cybera

                ack where criminals
                deceive users to obtain their credentials through a login form that
                submits the data to a <mark>malicious server.</mark> . In this,we compare machine
                learning and deep learning techniques to present a method capable
                of detecting phishing websites through URL analysis.And we have
                used
                ask framework to implement our project.</p>
                <p><b>project name:</b>Name: Predicting <strong>hot events</strong> in the early period through Bayesian model for social networks</p>
                <p><b>project Details:</b>Predicting emerging hot events in an early stage is essential for
                    various applications including information dissemination mining
                    ads recommendation and etc. Existing techniques either require a
                    long-term observation over the event or features that are expensive
                    to extract.However,given limited data at the early stage of an
                    
                    emerging event.The temporal features of hot events and non-
                    events are not distinctive enough yet.In this work we introduce
                    
                    BEEP a Bayesian perspective early stage event prediction model.
                    That teaches this dilemma. Domain:<strong>Data mining * Front end- J2EE back end mysql</strong></p>
